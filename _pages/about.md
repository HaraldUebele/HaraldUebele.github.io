### Who am I?

My name is Harald Uebele. I used to work for IBM as a Developer Advocate but I have retired from work end of October 2020. Still interested in Cloud technologies, though.

I started to work with and use “The Cloud” in 2014 with IBM Bluemix which was built around Cloud Foundry. Since then I have worked with Docker, Kubernetes, Istio, Knative. Bluemix turned into IBM Cloud.
