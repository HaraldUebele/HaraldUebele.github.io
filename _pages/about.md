### Who am I?

My name is Harald Uebele. I used to work for IBM as a Developer Advocate but I have retired from work in November 2020. Still interested in Cloud technologies, though.

I started to work with and use “The Cloud” in 2014 with IBM Bluemix which was built around Cloud Foundry originally. Since then I have worked with Docker and Containers, Kubernetes, OpenShift, Istio, Knative. In the meantime, Bluemix turned into the IBM Cloud.
