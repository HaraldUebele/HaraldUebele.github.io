I attended the W-JAX 2019 conference beginning of November in Munich. It is a big conference for software developers and had somewhere between 1300 and 1500 participants. Here are some impressions and pictures.

This is the team preparing our booth: unpacking, setting up the background

Jason McGee, IBM Fellow, Vice President and CTO of IBM Cloud Platform gave a keynote on "[The 20 Year Platform – bringing together Kubernetes, 12-Factor and Functions](https://jax.de/cloud-container-serverless/the-20-year-platform-bringing-together-kubernetes-12-factor-and-functions/){:target="_blank"}".

The next IBM session at W-JAX was Niklas Heidloff and myself explaining "[How to develop your first cloud-native app in Java](https://jax.de/cloud-container-serverless/wie-entwickle-ich-meine-ersten-cloud-nativen-applikationen-mit-java/){:target="_blank"}". I never had such an attentive audience asking so many clever questions ... maybe giving out swag (T-Shirts with the cool IBM rebus logo) for asking good questions does help :-)

And finally Jeremias Werner, Senior Software Developer at the IBM Böblingen lab, presented "[A peek behind the scenes and how Knative is changing the serverless landscape](https://jax.de/speaker/jeremias-werner/){:target="_blank"}" (unfortunately the link to his agenda topic doesn't work: HTTP 404):

Between the talks we were quite busy at the booth:
